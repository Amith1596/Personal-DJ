# QA Checklist

- /qa lets me: load two files, detect BPM/Key, choose recipe, render 2-bar preview.
- No console errors; TypeScript clean.
- Audible: no clicks; crossfade sounds intentional; peak < −0.3 dBFS.
- On hard tempos (90 vs 128 BPM), candidates still land on musically sensible points.
- PWA still installs/loads offline (shell).
